# hello-world
Hello World, my name is Stevie, Creative Director with the Seal Society, an NFT project on Cardano.
** A bit about me ** - I like to create things, I am what people call an Entrepreneur, some one who has the drive to create new things. I like music for its vibration, I like Art for its stimulation. I have a family whom I love dearly and do everything I can for. My driving force is my Father, whom has the Hustlers spirit. I am here on Github to learn and collab with others in the space.
